# RPS_game
a rock paper scissors text based game

developed in ubutnu and nvim
this projects target was to learn how to inizialize a git repo, Code in C#, and run that code.

all the above targets where met.

further things that i would like to do with this project:

- remake the project under the rules of OOP,
- add code comments to the code to make it actually readable,
- work out how lazy git functions with pushing code, as i had to manually push everything from the command line.
